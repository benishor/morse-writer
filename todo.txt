Usage:

	morse-writer -i book.txt -o output.wav -s 20 -f 500 -w sine -p 1.5 

		-i = input file to be rendered
		-o = output wav file
		-s = speed in WPM (defaults to 20)
		-f = signal frequency in Hz (defaults to 600)
		-p = punchiness. float. the greater, the more distorted the signal will be  (defaults to 0)

What it does:
	- reads the specified file and renders it as wav into the specified output file
	- unknown characters are translated to ?

TODO:
	- configurable samplerate
	- configurable output channels (mono/stereo)
